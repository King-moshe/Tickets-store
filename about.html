                    <p>
                        Club DJs, commonly referred as DJs in general, play music at musical events, such as parties at
                        music venues or bars, clubs, music festivals, corporate and private events. Typically, club DJs
                        mix
                        music recordings from two or more sources using different mixing techniques to produce
                        non-stopping
                        flow of music.


                        One key technique used for seamlessly transitioning from one song to another is
                        beatmatching. A
                        DJ
                        who mostly plays and mixes one specific music genre is often given the title of that genre;
                        for
                        example, a DJ who plays hip hop music is called a hip hop DJ, a DJ who plays house music is
                        a
                        house
                        DJ, a DJ who plays techno is called a techno DJ, and so on.

                        The quality of a DJ performance (often called a DJ mix or DJ set) consists of two main
                        features:
                        technical skills, or how well the DJ can operate the equipment and produce smooth
                        transitions
                        between two or more recordings and a playlist; and the ability of a DJ to select the most
                        suitable
                        recordings, also known as "reading the crowd".

                        Hip hop DJs
                        DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa were members of a block party at South
                        Bronx.
                        Kool Herc played records such as James Brown's "Give It Up or Turnit a Loose", Jimmy
                        Castor's
                        "It's
                        Just Begun", Booker T. & the M.G.'s' "Melting Pot", Incredible Bongo Band's "Bongo Rock" and
                        "Apache", and UK rock band Babe Ruth's "The Mexican". With Bronx clubs struggling with
                        street
                        gangs,
                        uptown DJs catering to an older disco crowd with different aspirations, and commercial radio
                        also
                        catering to a demographic distinct from teenagers in the Bronx, Herc's parties had a
                        ready-made
                        audience.

                        DJ Kool Herc developed the style that was the blueprint for hip hop music. Herc used the
                        record
                        to
                        focus on a short, heavily percussive part in it: the "break". Since this part of the record
                        was
                        the
                        one the dancers liked best, Herc isolated the break and prolonged it by changing between two
                        record
                        players. As one record reached the end of the break, he cued a second record back to the
                        beginning
                        of the break, which allowed him to extend a relatively short section of music into a
                        "five-minute
                        loop of fury". This innovation had its roots in what Herc called "The Merry-Go-Round", a
                        technique by which the deejay switched from break to break at the height of the party. This
                        technique is specifically called "The Merry-Go-Round" because according to Herc, it takes
                        one
                        "back
                        and forth with no slack."

                        <p>
                            What is a marketing manager?
                            Marketing covers a vast spectrum of duties within a business, from the promotion of products
                            and services right the way through to analysing data and setting strategy for how a company
                            is going to grow.

                            Because marketing can have a profound effect on every element of a company and the way it
                            operates, marketing management is a very responsible role. Primarily the marketing
                            department exists to find new ways of generating revenues and customers aligned with the
                            fast-moving pace of technology, as well as optimising and modernising traditional marketing
                            methods.

                            A creative mind and a head for business are essential to succeed in the role of a marketing
                            manager. Strong communication coupled with the ability to lead and motivate a team are
                            considered core skills for this position.

                            Marketing management is an available and accessible career path for anyone at any stage in
                            their career, and salaries for marketing managers are generous. For those seeking to
                            progress quickly, senior marketing opportunities are plentiful, with wages and benefits
                            increasing with experience and level of responsibility. Most importantly, marketing
                            management is a fun career choice; it can offer the potential to travel, handle luxury goods
                            and services, attend large events, and even take part in new technology trials.
